Heat is replaced with Divergence: as you make waves in the time stream, it starts to shift away from what you are familiar with. The higher Divergence is, the weirder you are to everyday inhabitants of the timeline. High enough, and you essentially come under fire from the timeline’s immune system.

## Divergence Levels

* 0 Divergence: Smooth and quiet, low damage to the time stream
* 2 Divergence: Contained, reparable damage to the time stream
* 4 Divergence: Chaotic, multiple damages to the time stream
* 6 Divergence: Devistating, irreparable damage to the time stream

Add +1 Divergence for a high profile or extreme anachronism. Add +1 Divergence for a situation happening in a hostile or unfamiliar time stream. Add +1 Divergence if you're at war with another faction. Add +2 Divergence if killing was involved or if someone was permanently removed from the time stream (whether the crew did the killing and/or removing or not—bodies and holes in time attract attention).

When your Divergence level reaches 9, you create a Time Ripple and clear your Divergence (any excess Divergence “rolls over,” so if your heat was 7 and you took 4 Divergence, you’d reset with 2 Divergence marked).

## Incarceration

The only way to remove and smooth out your crew’s Time Ripples is through incarceration. When one of your crew members, friends, contacts—or a framed enemy—is convicted and incarcerated for time crimes associated with your crew, your Time Ripples are smoothed out and therefore reduced by 1 and you clear your Divergence.

Incarceration may result from investigation and arrest by the Time Police, or because someone turns themselves in and takes the fall for the crew’s crimes.

The severity of the prison sentence depends on your wanted level:

* 0 Time Ripple: 3 months community service—Help restore a small section of time to it's norm. Or, the Time Police make you an informant for a short-term investigation (1-3 months).
* 1 Time Ripple: 3 months in a closed loop. Or, the Time Police make you an informant for a long-term investigation (3-6 months).
* 2 Time Ripple: 6 months in a closed loop
* 3 Time Ripple: 1-3 years in a closed loop
* 4 Time Ripple: Permanent removal from the time stream into a closed loop
