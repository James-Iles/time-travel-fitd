The score is the central play unit of A Stitch in Time. They’re how you effect change to the timestream, get rich, and take down your foes.

Each score shares this basic structure:
1. Travel to your starting point in time and space with your Device.
2. Set the score’s duration.
3. Activate the Device to branch off a part of the timestream. Roll Engagement.
4. Achieve your objective within the branch.
5. Get to the end of the branch and weave it back into the timeline.

Here’s more details:
## Step 1: Set the Origin Point
Each score has a point of origin: the place the created timeline branch will begin from. Once you begin your score you won’t be able to affect anything that happens before this point.
You can use your group’s Device to travel to this point, or earlier (see Downtime travel). 
Don’t worry too much about the precise details of your plan; just pick one of these and fill in the required details.
* Embed: Start a few months or years before the job, and get a mundane role that puts you in position. Detail: The role you’re trying to take.
* Slide: Appear in a vulnerable position within the area of operation, with no witnesses. Detail: How you work out what’s vulnerable.
* Ambush: Appear directly on top of the target, ready for a fight. Details: Initial battle plan.
* Butterfly: If all goes well, you never interact with the target, instead altering their past to control their present. Details: Their vulnerability you’re exploiting.
* Substitution: Try to swap out an object for another with nobody noticing. Details: The point where the object is exposed.
## Step 2: Set Branch Parameters
How much time do you give yourselves? Less, and you may have to rush to get everything done. More, and you don’t know how things can go awry as you’re playing out the clock. Remember that the only way to leave a job early is by **Crashing Out**.

Also, your Device will output a certain quantity of Black Boxes: opaque containers of some sort sent back by your future self. Decide how many you receive: Few (1-3), Some (4-5), Many (6). The more of these time-displaced objects you have, the more you stand out as an anomaly when people Weathervane you. You can open some of the Black Boxes right now, if you wish (see **Gear**).
## Step 3: Engagement Roll
When you’re in place and ready to go, you activate your Device. It immediately clones a chunk of the timeline off as a branch. To see how well this goes, you roll Engagement.
The Engagement roll is a **fortune roll**, starting at 1d for sheer luck. Adjust your dice pool for any advantages and disadvantages in play.

### Major Advantages/Disadvantages
* Is this operation particularly bold or daring? Take +1d. Is this operation overly complex or contingent on many factors? Take -1d. 
* Does the plan’s detail expose a vulnerability of the target or hit them where they’re weakest? Take +1d. Is the target strongest against this approach, or do they have particular defenses or special preparations? Take -1d. 
* Can any of your friends or contacts provide aid or insight for this operation? Take +1d. Are any enemies or rivals interfering in the operation? Take -1d. 
* Are there any other elements that you want to consider? Maybe a lower-Reach target will give you +1d. Maybe a higher-Reach target will give you -1d. Maybe there’s a situation in the district that makes the operation more or less tricky. 

### Roll Results
* Critical: Exceptional result. You’re in a controlled position for what’s next and the branch is strong: ignore the first point of Timeline Strain it takes.
* 6: Good result. You’re in a controlled position when the action starts. 
* 4/5: Mixed result. You’re in a risky position when the action starts. 
* 1-3: Bad result. You’re in a desperate position when the action starts, or you take a point of Timeline Strain and are in a risky position.

## Step 4: The Score!
Do whatever it is you came here to do: steal, persuade, assassinate, rob, manipulate, etc.
The group share a ‘present’, which moves from the start of the loop to the end of the loop at a second per second. You can temporarily shift your mind and/or body forwards or backwards from this point (see *Flashes*), but the ‘present’ is where you return to.
At any point, any still-living members of the group can call for a **reset**, reaching out to the Device instinctively. The Device will respond by returning the entire branch to its origin point, with every PC remembering what they experienced in the prior run. Each PC knows who triggered the reset.
### Reset Effects
Conditions are rolled back to their status at the start of the run.
Frag, Paradox and Load remain where they were at the point a character chose to reset. 
The reset strains the branch’s integrity, dealing it a point of Timeline Strain.
Start playing through the next branch at the point players choose to diverge from a prior run - assume everything happened exactly the same up to that point.
### Running out the clock
If you hit the end of your branch, everything stops. Linked by the Device, the group (and any other peers present) can communicate with each other in a dreamlike fashion, but nothing about the physical state of the world can change. At this point you have two options: *reset* or *exit* (see Prune and Merge).
## Step 5: Making an Exit
Eventually, you’ll need to return to the core timeline. There’s two ways to do this:
### Crash Out
Maybe you want to make an exit, and don’t have the luxury of making it neat. To crash out, someone just needs to make it back to the Device and activate it. It’ll take a few moments to spool up, and then pull all of you inside its core loop and collapse the branch. Each of you will be in the exact state you were in at the point the **Crash Out** was triggered. As for the rest of the branch… that’s a bit messier. In your wake, fragments of the branch will impact into the core timeline - this is, as you may expect, Not Good. See *Ripples* for more.
### Prune and Merge
The alternative is to last out until the end of the branch. If you have time remaining between the score’s completion and the branch’s endpoint, you may want to use it carefully tidying up your actions to minimise any conflicts with the core timeline. Or you may wish to spend it running away from the hostiles pursuing you. Up to you. When you hit the end, you enter the timeless state as described in *Running out the clock*, and can instruct your Device to begin the merging process. 
As you communally guide it through stitching the changed branch into the timeline and overwriting what was there before, you’ll have the chance to identify points of strain and conflict - paradoxes in the making. With a deft hand, you can prune and bend timelines without breaking them and ensure that most of what you wanted to happen will have happened with the minimum of knock-on effects. For more on this, see *Ripples*. And once the merging’s complete, you’ll be in the core timeline at the geographic point you occupied when the branch ran out. If you’re in danger, deal with it how you like - fight it off, spool up your Device and get out of there, etc.
