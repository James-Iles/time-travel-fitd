The different misfortunes your crew can suffer go far beyond the physical. To reflect this, you don’t track Harm, but instead track Conditions. There are six - three minor, three major.
## Minor Conditions
If you have a minor condition marked, it’ll shape what’s possible for you to do in the fiction. If the condition would impact on your actions, you may be acting at a lower *effect* (GM’s discretion).
* Injured: You’re hurt - bleeding, bruised, sprained.
* Watched: Others are actively aware of your presence and tracking you. 
* Tired: You’ve been burning the midnight oil, or you’ve pushed yourself beyond your physical limits. Your energy reserves are low.
## Major Conditions
If you have a major condition marked, it’s a big deal. Barring special circumstances, you’ll be unable to take action until the other characters rescue you and resolve the condition.
Note: You can still perform Flashes while you have a Major condition marked, but they cost one extra point of Frag thanks to the increased mindfuckery involved.
* Dead: You have shuffled off this mortal coil.
* Trapped: Hostile agents have you in their clutches and are preventing your escape.
* Lost: You don’t know where you are, or how you’d get back together with the other characters.
## Avoiding Conditions
To defend against marking Conditions, you have two options:
* *Resist* the Condition by borrowing from your past or future self with Insight, Rampancy or Projection (see **Resistance Rolls**). A successful Resistance Roll will normally remove a Mild Condition or turn a Major Condition into a Mild one.
* Expending a *Retcon*. These are limited-use timeline patches - by expending one and applying it to the timeline, you change the past such that you never suffered the Condition with minimal other changes. There are two sources of Retcons:
	* Gear. An Hourglass (a disposable time loop contained in a crystal sphere) takes up 1 box. A Surrogate (a mindless clone of yourself kept in a spatial pocket to take your place) takes up 3 boxes.
	* Innate Retcons. Certain advances (e.g. The Hopper’s *Rewind*) give you a self-generating loop attached to your personal timeline. It’s usable once per score.
