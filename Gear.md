##Gear

* Time Scissors: all crews have the ability to change time in small ways. These "scissors" give you the ability to manipulate the timeline. [1 load]
* A Large Weapon: this weapon is too big to hold in one hand and will do heavy damage to your opponent. These can be manufactured to look like whatever time period your crew is working in, from a double-bladed battle-axe to a concrete baseball bat to a machine gun to a double-barelled blaster pistol to a two-handed weapon that fires hard light. [2 load]
* An Unusual Weapon: an anachronism. This weapon can be anything that harms another, as long as it is anachronistic to the time period your crew is working in. [1 load]
* Armor: A pouch that attaches wherever is easiest and projects a minor force field around you. [2 load]
  +Heavy: A backpack, unwieldly, that can protect your entire body for longer. This can only be used  if you are already carrying armor. [3 load]
* Contemporary clothes: sneak in unnanounced and always be prepared with a set of clothes perfect for whenever you're heading
