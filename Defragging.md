Vices have been replaced by defragging. Humans are not meant to travel through the time stream and with this comes a cost. 

Characters turn to defragging, ways of relaxing between missions to relax before jumping through time again.

Choose Your Defragging Process (Belongs in Character Creation section)
-Pleasure: Traveling through time to visit famous locations, experiences joyous moments in human history, and kissing famous people
-Drifting (temp): You relax by floating outside of all existing timelines or riding one timeline as it collapses into another.
