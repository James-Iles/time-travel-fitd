Vices have been replaced by defragging. Humans are not meant to travel through the time stream and with this comes a cost. 

Characters turn to defragging, ways of relaxing between missions to relax before jumping through time again.

Choose Your Defragging Process (Belongs in Character Creation section)
- Pleasure: Traveling through time to visit famous locations, experiences joyous moments in human history, and kissing famous people.
- Drifting: You relax by floating outside of all existing timelines or riding one timeline as it collapses into another.
- Sanitation: You rigorously go through your personal timeline rectifying inconsistencies and paradoxes, acting as your own temporal janitor.
- Prosaic: You go back to a normal life, or maybe start up a new one. You live it for a few months or a year, basking in flatline life, and then jump back to the crew when youâ€™re done.
