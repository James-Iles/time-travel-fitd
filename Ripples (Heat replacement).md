Every change you make can have unintended consequences. Though the timeline has some momentum to it, and it takes more effort than you might think to turn butterflies into hurricanes, it’s hard to leave no trace. To reflect this, your crew acquires **ripples** as they make changes. After a score or conflict with an opponent, your crew takes ripples according to the **timeline strain** of the mission’s branch.

Add +1 ripple for a time travel-aware target. 
Add +1 ripple if the score happened at an earlier  timepoint than you have a base. 
Add +1 ripple if you’re at war with another faction. 
Add +2 ripple if you crashed out of the score.

You mark ripple levels on the ripple tracker on the crew sheet.

When your ripple level reaches 9, you gain a **divergence level** and clear your ripples (any excess ripples “roll over,” so if your ripples were at 7 and you took 4 ripples, you’d reset with 2 ripples marked).

The higher your divergence level, the more strange you are in comparison to the rest of the timeline, and the stronger the immune reaction the timeline will muster against you.

Also, your divergence level contributes to the severity of the **entanglements** that your crew faces after a score. See page XX for details.
