Every change you make can have unintended consequences. Though the timeline has some momentum to it, and it takes more effort than you might think to turn butterflies into hurricanes, it’s hard to leave no trace. To reflect this, your crew acquires \<span class="game-term"\>ripples\</span\> as they make changes. After a score or conflict with an opponent, your crew takes \<span class="game-term"\>ripples\</span\> according to the \<span class="game-term"\> timeline strain \</span\> of the mission’s branch.

Add +1 \<span class="game-term"\>ripple\</span\> for a time travel-aware target. 
Add +1 \<span class="game-term"\> ripple\</span\> if the score happened at an earlier  timepoint than you have a base. 
Add +1 \<span class="game-term"\> ripple\</span\> if you’re at war with another faction. 
Add +2 \<span class="game-term"\> ripple\</span\> if you crashed out of the score.

You mark \<span class="game-term"\> ripple\</span\> levels on the \<span class="game-term"\> ripple\</span\> tracker on the crew sheet.

When your \<span class="game-term"\> ripple\</span\> level reaches 9, you gain a \<span class="game-term"\>divergence level\</span\> and clear your \<span class="game-term"\> ripples\</span\> (any excess \<span class="game-term"\> ripples\</span\> “roll over,” so if your \<span class="game-term"\> ripples\</span\> were at 7 and you took 4 \<span class="game-term"\> ripples\</span\>, you’d reset with 2 \<span class="game-term"\> ripples\</span\> marked).

The higher your \<span class="game-term"\>divergence level\</span\>, the more strange you are in comparison to the rest of the timeline, and the stronger the immune reaction the timeline will muster against you.

Also, your \<span class="game-term"\>divergence level\</span\> contributes to the severity of the **entanglements** that your crew faces after a score. See page \<a\>XX\</a\> for details.
