* Branch: A section of the master timeline cloned and spun out into the void. Until a branch is merged back in with the master timeline, nothing in it will affect the master timeline.
* Device: An object that allows for time travel. It may be technological, organic, steampunk, primal, whatever - the important thing is that it houses a perfect time loop, ouroborosly curled in on itself and entirely independent from the timeline.
* Era: A particular section of history. There are five: Early History, Late History, Modern, Near Future, Far Future. 
* Flash: A short hop into the past or the future, before returning to the present.
* Flatliner: Anyone not linked to a Device, and instead chained to timeâ€™s arrow.
* Frag: A manifestation of strain in your own personal timeline. Gained by scrubbing back and forth along your personal timeline (see Flash) or drawing from your past or future strength to Push Yourself.
* Peer: A time traveller linked to a Device.
