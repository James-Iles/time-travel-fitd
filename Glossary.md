* Branch: A section of the master timeline cloned and spun out into the void. Until a branch is merged back in with the master timeline, nothing in it will affect the master timeline.
* Device: An object that allows for time travel. It may be technological, organic, steampunk, primal, whatever - the important thing is that it houses a perfect time loop, ouroborosly curled in on itself and entirely independent from the timeline.
* Era: A particular section of history. There are five: Early History, Late History, Modern, Near Future, Far Future. 
* Flatliner: Anyone not linked to a Device, and instead chained to timeâ€™s arrow.
* Peer: A time traveller linked to a Device.
